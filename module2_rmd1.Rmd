This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


```{r pressure2, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 5}
plot(pressure)
```


```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars),
             caption = 'Table 1. Top ten rows of the cars dataset')

head(mtcars)

```

```{r load_printr}
library(printr)

head(mtcars)

```
